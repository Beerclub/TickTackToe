#Design report

We wanted it to look simple and to be a easy pleaser. No fancy appearance, just a straightforward game with one main purpose; let the user play tic-tac-toe!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We decided to make the game web based; a good combination of html and java. The user goes to a front page, which introduces him to what is coming (the name of the game) and a hyperlink which links to another page which contains only the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we sat down to write the logic behind the game, we aimed to have the code as simple as possible (because we are simple folk). The code would only have one class with few, but useful functions. We only have one class because we are using the Spark web framework and we thought it would only cause trouble to have more. Mainly because we saw that we would have some inner class troubles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have an array which stores the information about every field in the table (3x3 table, just like the basic tic-tac-toe is set up). If you haven&#39;t chosen a field, then the field stores a button for the user to choose if he wants to (and by that he can mark the field with either X or O).</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><img height="290" src="http://i.imgur.com/T6kENjO.png" width="364"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our simple but useful class diagram</span></p></body></html>
